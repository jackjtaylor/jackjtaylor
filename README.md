<h1 align="left">Hey 👋, what's up?</h1>

<p align="left">I'm Jack Taylor, a developer from Australia, living in Germany.</p>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

  - ✨ I've been writing code since I was a teenager, and professionally for over two years.
      
  - 🎯 My goal is to create more full-scale personal projects, for here.

###

<p align="left">As a developer, I've worked with a range of technologies and projects. I started creating Python projects when I was a teenager, and I still love the language to this day. I love its simplicity, ability to get projects up and running fast, and its automation potential. 

I later studied a Bachelor of Information Technology and I was exposed to a wide range of tech stacks. I created full-stack websites and mobile applications with JavaScript, Angular, Ionic and other languages. I also learnt extensively about documentation, management and the 'other' parts of development, which helps me to this day. When creating a new repository or project, I aim to always document well, stay with a structure and keep code as readable as possible.

I also created projects with Java, creating simple applications and command-line tools. I also created, using a graphics library alongside me, a three-dimensional raycaster-based environment. This was one of my most beloved Java-based projects, as there were no real resources online, and I had to use retro development articles and assets to decide how to develop the engine.

I created two-dimensional and three-dimensional games with Unity and Unreal Engine, ranging from first-person-shooters (FPSs) to side-scrollers. I later worked with Unreal Engine professionally, and developed engine tools and plugins with Python, C++ and Blueprints.

I sadly had many more projects that were developed, but were lost on a hard-drive, or never uploaded to GitHub. This is why my GitHub portfolio might look a bit bare, but rest assured, talk to me and I'm sure I'll have plenty of projects to discuss!

<p align="left"> I pride myself on being a clear, understandable and communicating developer. I strive to always document code, write clear naming conventions, format and cleanup code, and more. More importantly, I strive to push clear, simple commits and communicate my changes effectively with team members. I'm an easy and outgoing person, and communication is second nature to me.</p>
